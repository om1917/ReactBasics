useRef Hook / React.forwardRef Hook

For eg. You have to make a common button for login and after login pages. Then your button state is present
where you define your button but you need that state in another pages i.e. login page or any other page (coz
you made that button common). 
Therefore React.forwardRef hook comes to play.
